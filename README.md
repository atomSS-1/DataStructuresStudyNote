# DataStructuresStudyNote

## Projects will be done on C++
### [study projects](https://github.com/k89jy/DataStructuresStudyNote/projects)

## Reason Why I did this : Emphasie dataSturcture when programming.
# Thoughts about data stuctures:
Aim of the subject or programmin data stucture is to make data orderly in order to fetch data fast as possible.
Data when applied in real programming will be Scheduler in OS, indexing in mySQL, network routing in routers, algorithms in File System, etc
